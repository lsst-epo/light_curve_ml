Clustering of Star Light A starlight curve is a time series of brightness of a
 celestial object as a function of time. The study of light curves in astronomy
 is associated with the study of variability of sources. This is a dataset with
 1,000 (purportedly) phase-aligned starlight curves of length 1,024, whose
 classes (3 total) has been determined by an expert. Each line is a comma-separated
 set of numbers. The first number is the class label and subsequence numbers are the time series
